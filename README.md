# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection.
This project detects fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning. It includes data preprocessing, class balancing with SMOTE, feature engineering, and model selection. Random Forest and Gradient Boosting are used for evaluation, ensuring high accuracy while minimizing false positives. 

## Overview
This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. It explores data preprocessing, feature engineering, class balancing, and model evaluation.
